# Lowbar - Collections, Functions and Language

## Goals

1.  Continue practicing test-driven development (TDD) - both the process and the tools you'll be using to do it from now until the end of the course (and beyond).
2.  Get an 'inside view' of one of the most heavily used JavaScript libraries, [lodash](https://lodash.com/) (50m downloads on NPM last month).
3.  Lay the foundations for understanding the functional style of programming that JS lends itself so well to.

## Tasks

On this sprint we'll implement lowbar.js, our own version of the popular utilities library lodash.js. The methods you should implement are listed below, but feel free to implement any others you find interesting if you finish.

## Core

These are the core functions you should aim to get finished. Note that some of these names will look familiar, but you need to check the documentation as they may offer additional functionality.

• identity

• take

• uniq

• forEach

• map

• filter

• reduce

• once

• before

• spread

• after

• overArgs

You should be heavily referencing the APIs of the following:

1.  [lodash](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.4/)
2.  [The Chai Assertion Library](http://chaijs.com/)
3.  [Testing with spies](http://sinonjs.org/)

### Advanced

• chunk

• remove

• shuffle

• conformsTo

• sortedIndex

• sortBy

• difference

• intersection

• delay

### _Very_ Advanced

• partial

• memoize
NOTE: You do not need to attempt the second argument (resolver) or making the cache property available.

• invoke

• invokeMap
